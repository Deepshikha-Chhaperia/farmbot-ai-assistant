- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Feature Requests

We actively welcome feature requests! Please [open an issue](https://github.com/Deepshikha-Chhaperia/farmbot-ai-assistant/issues) with:
- Clear description of the feature
- Why it would be valuable for farmers
